# Weather Data Analysis with Python 🌤️

This project demonstrates how to use **Python and Pandas** to analyze a real-world weather dataset. I explored the data using various pandas functions and answered several analytical questions.

## 📌 Skills Practiced
- Data loading and exploration
- Dataset inspection (`head()`, `shape`, `dtypes`, etc.)
- Handling null values
- Filtering conditions and queries
- Calculating statistics (mean, std, variance)
- Grouping and aggregation

## 📊 Questions Answered
1. Unique Wind Speed values
2. Times when Weather is Clear
3. Records with Wind Speed = 4 km/h
4. Null values detection
5. Renaming columns
6. Calculating Mean, Std, and Variance
7. Records with Snow or Fog
8. Multiple condition queries

## 🧰 Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
